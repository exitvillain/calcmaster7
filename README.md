- 👻 I’m a cyber security engineer , ethical hacker, and software developer
     who wants to write his own exploits instead of running someone else's 
- 😈 I'm interested in building hacker tools, writing exploits, and reverse engineering. Check out my cyber sec blog at exitvillain.com 
- 🤖 I also enjoy systems programming and web programming and a bit of artificial intelligence. 
- 🔒 Let's be honest some of my projects here are just for show. I want to demonstrate to future employers some programs I have written, such as
  my programming assignments from the harvard artificial intelligence class, cs50AI. I think the two programs that actually ARE usefull are wordsmith and 
  musician multiplication.  If you like to read and look up words while you read, try wordsmith! It's great. Also,if you want to know your musical keys as 
  well as you know your times tables up to 12, check out music multiplcation!
